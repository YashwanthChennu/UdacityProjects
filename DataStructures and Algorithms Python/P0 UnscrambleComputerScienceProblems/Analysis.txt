Run time Analysis

#Task 0
	It has run time complexity of O(1). This task doesnot have any of the loops or iterations and 
there are 4 + 4 statements in the task so the time complexity is O(4) .For simplicity it is considered as O(1).

#Task 1
	It has run time complexity of O(n). This task has only one for loop with one conditional statement so n + 1
so it can be considered as O(n)
#Task 2
	It has run time complexity of O(n). This task has only one for loop with one conditional statement so n + 1
	so it can be considered as O(n)
#Task 3
	It has run time complexity of O(n). Since we have two loops which runs through all the records so n + n = O(2n) and
 few conditional statement. For simplicity it is considered as o(n) .

#Task 4
	It has run time complexity of O(n). Since we have two loops which runs through all the records so n + n = O(2n) and
 few conditional statement. For simplicity it is considered as o(n) .
